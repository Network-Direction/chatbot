# Web Service
  A web service runs continually, and listens for webhooks and authentication details
  The web service is built in Flask

## Routes
### /test
  Method: GET, HEAD
  A simple route, used to test if the service is up
  This can be polled by a monitoring solution
   
### /mist
  Method: POST
  This is where Mist webhooks are sent

### /callback
  Method: GET
  This is the callback point for authentication with the MS Identify Platform
  During authentication, the client code will be sent here
  This URL needs to be registered in the application on the Identity Platform (see ms-identity.txt)


## web-service.py
### To Do
  (1) Find out why users get presented with two authentication web screens when the process first starts
  (2) Find an alternative to saving the token in a file; Variables don't work simply between Flask routes

### Global
  (1) Read configuration file (using config.py), and set variables
  (2) Initialize a Flask app
  (3) Begin authentication
  (4) Start the Flask routes
